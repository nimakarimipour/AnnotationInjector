## Note
This project moved to a new repository. Please visit [Injector](https://github.com/nimakarimipour/Injector).

Sorry for the inconvenience. The base framework of the repo is ```open re-write``` which no longer supports our needs. The most current version [Injector](https://github.com/nimakarimipour/Injector) is written with [JavaParser](https://javaparser.org).
